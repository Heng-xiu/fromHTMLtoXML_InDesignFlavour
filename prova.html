<h1>The Conversions of St. Augustine</h1>
<h2>Book I</h2>
<blockquote>Great art Thou, O <i>Lord</i>, and greatly to be praised; great is <em>Thy</em> power, and Thy wisdom infinite. And Thee would man praise; man, but a particle of Thy creation; man, that bears about him his mortality, the witness of his sin, the witness that Thou resistest the proud: yet would man praise Thee; he, but a <b>particle</b> of <strong>Thy creation</strong>.</blockquote>
